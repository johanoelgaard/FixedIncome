    "## Problem 1\n",
    "In this problem, we will examine an interest rate payer swap where payments to the floating leg are more frequent than payments to the fixed leg. Assume that we consider an interest rate swap that pays coupons of size $ R $ to the fixed leg $ I $ times a year, pays simple LIBOR rate coupons to the floating leg $ J $ times a year, matures in exactly $ N $ years, and has a principal of $ K $. Also assume that $ M = \\frac{J}{I} $ and $ N $ are positive integers. If it helps, you can think of $ I = 2 $, $ J = 4 $, and $ N = 10 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we will consider the interest rate swap at time of issuance at $( t = T_0 = 0 )$. Denote the times of coupon payments to the floating leg by $ T_1, T_2, \\dots, T_{JN} $, corresponding to fixings announced at times $( T_0, T_1, \\dots, T_{JN−1} )$, and denote the LIBOR rate announced at time $ T_i $ to be paid at time $ T_{i+1} $ by $ L(T_i, T_{i+1}) $. Finally, we assume that zero coupon bond prices $ p(t, T) $ are available for all $ T \\geq 0 $.\n"
