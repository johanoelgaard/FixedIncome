# Fixed Income Derivatives
University of Copenhagen, Fall 2024

This repository contains my suggested code for the 6 coding problem sets [`problem sets`](Problem%20Sets) and the provided theoretical solutions to all 8. Further, it contains notebooks for all the exam preparation [`examples`](Examples) as well a folder with my full solution to the [`final exam`](Final) for the course Fixed Income Derivatives at the University of Copenhagen. 

The [`final`](Final) folder contains a [`pdf`](Final/Final.pdf) submitted as the main answer to the exam, this is generated fom the [`notebook`](Final/Final.ipynb) pertaining thereto. Further the [`notebook`](Final/Final.ipynb) has been exported as a raw [`python script`](Final/Final.py) for ease of use. In addition to the main answer the folder contains the custom [`plotting library`](Final/plotting.py) used in the notebook and a slightly modified version of the [`course library`](Final/fixed_income_derivatives_E2024.py) used in the notebook.

All notebooks and the final exam are written by Johan Ã˜lgaard (jlh601@alumni.ku.dk).
